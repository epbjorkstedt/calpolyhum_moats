# chamber_network
This repo contains documentation and code for the chamber data copy and alarm network system. The same code (with modification) will also work for MOATS. This repo contains a copy of the network documentation. The original documentation is in [this folded](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bLHTs7VMsjC9X1WlTAR81oJC5sYHuz5H?usp=sharing) on google drive.  You should check the google drive for the latest version since the copy in this repo is not automatically maintained. 

Likewise, this repo contains a copy of the R app used for chamber graphing. The original app, maintained and updated by Paul, is in the [chamber_graphs]() repo. The app here works, but may not be the latest version.
